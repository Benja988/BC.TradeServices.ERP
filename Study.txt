Identifier => Name of a programming element(PascalCase) eg CustomerName
variable => location in memory where data is stored

variable initialization => given a default value before assigning a value

myint, nextint, thirdint : Integer;
isValid, doCheck : Boolean;

DataTypes = Fundamental, Complex

You can convert option values to integers
variable of type option *** You can't use optionmembers

Options in a table aren't extendable with a table extension
Enum=> Object

Only enums with extensible property set to true can be extended



AL supports 3 types of collection = {All Are strongly typed}
1. Arrays => Contains group of values of the same data types
=> An Array is declared as a variable with the following traits
✅An Identifier
✅A data type
✅One or more elements
✅A dimension

An Array holds multiple values stored in the elements of the array. You can access the arrays by using 
the index which can also be a value stored in another variable.

💥In AL you start counting at 1 for an array.


2. Lists
List types can only be used with fundamental types and represents a strongly types lis of values
that can be accessed by by index.


3. Dictionaries
Uses the System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<TKey,TValue> Class from the .NET Framework
Every Key that you create must be uniqueue


:= =>{Assignment Operator}

Expression - Is a formula that specifies how to generate a desired value and then evaluates to a value.
Operators:= unary, string, arithmetic, relational, logical

When you create a procedure and the procedure has finished running, if you want the
procedure to return something use exit statements
exit(<Expression>)
exit(param * param)

Table triggers are run before the action is taken.

The onvalidate trigger is called before data is stored in the database

OnlookUp is triggered when you perform a lookup to another table.
set tablerelation property on the field.

RunObject property can be used to open another page
